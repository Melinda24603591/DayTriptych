This repository contains the files for my EarSketch music composition project, DayTriptych.

Please note the following important details about file versions and usage:

Due to a system issue, Iâ€™m unable to save my final code to the EarSketch cloud.

As a result, the EarSketch link below points to an older version of my code.

The Python file (DayTriptych.py) in this repository contains the final and complete version of my project code.

The audio file (DayTriptych_audio .wav) is the final rendered output generated from that Python script.
